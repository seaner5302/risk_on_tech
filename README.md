# risk_on_tech
## Description
A portfolio with very high implied volatility ~0.65 (WARNING: very risky).
\
Agnostic to growth in US tech stocks as a sector and inflation of USD. This is achieved via risk parity.\
Normally, US Treasury Bonds would be a hedge in case of low economic growth suprises. However, it is my opinion that the bond market is in rough shape(lack of stability) and it is also my opinion that TSLA is outrageously overvalued. If TSLA were to return to a pre-earnings price of ~$238 per share, I would start reconsidering this short position and look for other investments that benefit from low economic growth.

I haven't owned these positions for a whole year yet, but I have been in for long enough to experience large gains and outperform all popular index funds for stocks (like SPY).
There is still more work to be done in terms of risk-adjusted returns, one reason the performance is so good is because the risk is also quite high (this is a trade-off).
