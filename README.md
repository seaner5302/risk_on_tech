# risk_on_tech
## Description
A portfolio with very high implied volatility ~0.65 (WARNING: very risky). Trying to be agnostic to growth in US tech stocks as a sector and inflation of USD. \
This is achieved via risk parity, thank you Ray Dalio (https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/the-all-weather-story). \

I would NOT recommend investing with this strategy if you are not planning on holding long term or if you do not have the free time available to rebalance frequently. This is higher maintenance than passive investing because of the massive volatility.
## Allocation Explained
### TSDD 22%
Normally, US Treasury Bonds would be a hedge in case of falling economic growth suprises. However, it is my opinion that the bond market is in rough shape due to lack of stability. It is also my opinion that TSLA is outrageously overvalued, making it a good choice for a short position TSDD. If TSLA were to return to a pre-earnings price of ~$238 per share (still overvalued), I would start reconsidering this short position and look for other investments that benefit from falling economic growth. 
### NVDA 36%
In terms of stock picks, I am of the opinion that Nvidia is still in the early stages of growth with demand for chips far outstripping supply. I predict that the demand for Nvidia chips will continue to grow at a fast pace as some of their cutting-edge applications recieve more mainstream attention. I know some investors are fearful of an "AI bubble", but I only think this would be possible if AI fails to deliver enough value which I find highly unlikely. We have already seen proof of concept in generating value with companies like Microsoft and Google producing very strong earnings reports in q1 2025. 
### GOOG 21%
I am bullish on Alphabet Inc. for similar reasons, they are the company most fairly valued that will make huge gains based on improved AI technology. Although Google's market share on search is going to be taken up by LLMs, I see Google cloud which will greatly benefits from AI, as the future of Google's business. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000043/goog-20250331.htm for q1 earnings 2025, note their capital expenditures and margins in the Google Cloud segment. \

### SHNY 21%
And lastly, Gold makes up such a large portion of this portfolio as a hedge against inflation, a "flight to safety" asset, and a bet against the USD. I think Cryptocurrencies present an interesting alternative to Gold, but since this portfolio has so much risk already, I decided to stick with Gold as a risk-off investment. Also worth considering buying Euro, Yen, etc. however, I don't have any experience researching currencies or exchange-rates.

## Closing Thoughts
I haven't owned these positions for a whole year yet, but I have held this portfolio for long enough to experience large gains and outperform all popular index funds for stocks (like SPY).
There is still more work to be done in terms of risk-adjusted returns, one reason the performance is so good is because the risk is also quite high (this is a trade-off).
